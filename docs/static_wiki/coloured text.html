You'll need to use the control-character &quot;\f&quot; (line-feed),<br />
If you need to use it interactively (in-game), you'll want to know it has the ASCII-code of 12;<br />
    * on linux you should be able to create it with Ctrl + L (ingame or in an editor) or Ctrl + V and then L (on the shell)<br />
    * on windows you should be able to create it via Alt-Gr + 1 + 2 (NumKeyPad). The key combination Ctrl-Alt can be used instead of AltGr if you don't have that key.<br />
    * you can also use <a href="files/Control_char_formfeed.txt">Control_char_formfeed.txt</a> (use &quot;Save Link as...&quot; from your browser!)<br />
<br />
Colourization (this also applies for CubeScript/ingame colours) works via the control-char followed by a indication character. Apart from the special cases of &quot;\fs&quot; and &quot;\fr&quot; for saving/restoring previously set colours in the current line of text you can use the following numbers to set to the respective colour:<br />
<br />
    * 0 : green<br />
    * 1 : blue<br />
    * 2 : yellow<br />
    * 3 : red<br />
    * 4 : gray<br />
    * 5 : magenta<br />
    * 6 : orange<br />
<br />
Everything else is drawn in white.
