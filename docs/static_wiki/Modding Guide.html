The top place to look for published MODs is - of course - on <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.quadropolis.us" rel="nofollow">quadropolis</a>.<br />
Use either the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.quadropolis.us/flexinode/table/3" rel="nofollow">table</a> or the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.quadropolis.us/flexinode/list/3" rel="nofollow">list</a> of available MODs.<br />
Always remember - the source is <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_license.html" rel="nofollow">zlib license</a>, the artwork under varying (but generally <em>more restrictive</em>) licenses.<br />
<br />
The TOP 3 &quot;DO&quot;'s for modding:<br />

<ol>
    <li>read the license, this means every available one and check they allow you to do what you want to do.in very short: you can use the source - provided your changes are made clear; but any media content (like maps, textures, images, ...) is not free for you to distribute. Their license is soley for dot3labs to distribute with Sauerbraten (except where EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE - such as free for all non-commercial use; if there is no explicitly stated license, it is for the Sauerbraten distribution ONLY). Any derived work of yours will have to either be a &quot;Total Conversion&quot; (e.g. make models and maps from scratch with your own texture set and all) or be a &quot;Client/Server MOD&quot; (e.g. small changes to either side of the game). In both cases you should never run these modifications on the regular network; best approach is to edit the designated ports for your MOD right away and never try to register modded servers on the sauerbraten masterserver!</li>
    <li>read the TODO and all developer info you find lying around, it helps!</li>
    <li>before bunny-hopping and trying to force network code on the (currently still budding) Eisenstern project, try implementing some nice new features or experimenting with new gamemodes.</li>
</ol>

<br />
The TOP 3 &quot;DO NOT&quot;'s for modding:<br />
<br />

<ol>
    <li>don't copy content (textures, maps, models, etc.) without consent by the <em>respective copyright holder</em> (see appropriate readme's). Inquire on forum if in doubt.</li>
    <li>don't use the official network for your MOD. This means you need <em>your own masterserver</em> and should use <em>different UDP ports</em> than the regular game.</li>
    <li>don't forget open source is free as in <em>free speech</em>, not as in <em>free beer</em>. See <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cubeengine.com/forum.php4?action=display_thread&amp;thread_id=1150&amp;start=33" rel="nofollow">forum post by Aardappel</a> (#34 of that thread)</li>
