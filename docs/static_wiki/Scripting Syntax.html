<h2 id="toc0">The basic command structure</h2>
Commands consist of the command itself, followed by any number of arguments seperated by whitespace.<br />
You can use <tt>&quot;&quot;</tt> to quote strings with whitespace in them (such as the actions in bind/alias),<br />
and whereever a command is required you can also use <tt>;</tt> to sequence multiple commands in one.<br />
<br />
You can evaluate aliases and expressions. You can substitute the value of an alias as an argument by prefixing it with a &quot;<tt>$</tt>&quot; sign, i.e.:<br />

<style type="text/css"><!--
/**
 * GeSHi (C) 2004 - 2007 Nigel McNie, 2007 - 2008 Benny Baumann
 * (http://qbnz.com/highlighter/ and http://geshi.org/)
 */
.text  {font-family:monospace;}
.text .imp {font-weight: bold; color: red;}
.text span.xtra { display:block; }

-->
</style><pre class="text" style="font-family:monospace;">echo The current value of x is $x</pre>

You can even substitute the values of console variables this way, i.e <tt>$fov</tt> gives the current fov.<br />
Some values though will not be returned in this way, noteably <tt>name</tt> and <tt>team</tt>. A solution for this is to work with buffer aliases to later access the value when needed.<br />
Some aliases are set automatically, for example $arg1 to $argN are set if you supply arguments when you execute an alias.<br />
But beware, these should not be tested for emptiness since they may contain values of preceding calls of other aliases!<br />
<br />
There are two alternatives to <tt>&quot;&quot;</tt> for quoting a string: <tt>()</tt> and <tt>[]</tt>.<br />
They work in the same way as <tt>&quot;&quot;</tt>, with the difference that they can be nested infinitely, and that they may contain linefeeds (useful for larger scripts). <tt>()</tt> is different from <tt>[]</tt> in that it evaluates the commands contained in it <em>before</em> it evaluates the surrounding command, and substitutes the results. <tt>()</tt> bracketed strings are called expressions, and <tt>[]</tt> bracketed strings may be thought of as blocks.<br />
<br />
An alternative to <tt>$x</tt> is <tt>@x</tt>, which uses an alias as a macro.<br />
The difference is that <tt>@x</tt> can be subtituted inside <tt>[]</tt> or <tt>()</tt> forms before they have ever been evaluated (at parse time), which makes them useful for composing strings or creating code on the fly. The <tt>@x</tt> form will be substituted using the value of <tt>x</tt> at the time the enclosing <tt>[]</tt> is evaluated. You can add more <tt>@</tt> prefixes to move up more levels of <tt>[]s</tt>, so <tt>@@x</tt> will move up two levels of <tt>[]s</tt> and so on. Example:<br />

.text  {font-family:monospace;}
.text .imp {font-weight: bold; color: red;}
.text span.xtra { display:block; }

-->
</style><pre class="text" style="font-family:monospace;">x = 0; if $cond [x = 1; [x = 2; echo @@x]]</pre>

will echo 0, since it uses the value of <tt>x</tt> at two levels up.<br />
<br />
The form <tt>@(body)</tt> is similar to <tt>@x</tt>, except that body contains commands executed at parse time.<br />
The result value after body executes is substituted in for <tt>@(body)</tt>. You may use multiple <tt>@</tt> prefixes as with the <tt>@x</tt> form.<br />
Example:<br />

<style type="text/css"><!--
/**
 * GeSHi (C) 2004 - 2007 Nigel McNie, 2007 - 2008 Benny Baumann

.text span.xtra { display:block; }

-->
</style><pre class="text" style="font-family:monospace;">@(result &quot;Hello, World!&quot;)</pre>

will substitute itself with <em>Hello, World!</em><br />
