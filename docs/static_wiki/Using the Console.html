<h2 id="toc0">Using commands on the console</h2>
From your local documentation (README.html ff.) you can always find out which commands the engine will react to!<br />
<br />
Single commands you enter into your console.<br />
Open your console with the <tt>saycommand</tt> (default key <tt>T</tt>) and then start with a slash (&quot;<tt>/</tt>&quot;).<br />
Or use a short script that is bound to the BACKQUOTE key :<br />

</style><pre class="text" style="font-family:monospace;">bind BACKQUOTE [saycommand /]
// for some language layouts, this is unusable in Sauerbraten though - so ... bind your own :) ... like:
bind CARET [saycommand /]</pre>

While entering the first word on the console and you're to lazy to type in a full command ... <br />
... say <tt>thirdpersondistance</tt> ... <br />
... you can auto-complete it with the TAB key,<br />
this also works for the mapnames in the <tt>map</tt> command, by the way.<br />
<br />
Everything following a command we call parameters. Some commands take parameters, some don't, <br />
some even behave differently depending on which way you call them.<br />
For example the <tt>fov</tt> command will - by itself - output the current FOV value,<br />
called with an integer parameter it will try to set your current <tt>field-of-vision</tt>.<br />
If you passed an illegal value here, so something outside the allowed range, it will also output which values it accepts. <br />
Other commands like this include <tt>particlesize</tt>, <tt>crosshairsize</tt> and <tt>skill</tt> (among others).<br />
<br />
Most commands will not output anything if they are called correctly.<br />
A noteable exception is the <tt>fullscreenshader</tt> command.<br />
This will output the succesfully activated shader - but conversely nothing if it fails.<br />
Since some shading FX are subtle to spot and still some gfx-cards can't display them.<br />
So it's probably for the best this way around.<br />
<br />
Another important feature of the console is the command history; <br />
by pressing the up arrow you can jump back to previous commands.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc1">Tired of typing?</h2>
So, you got the hang of the console?<br />
Now you find yourself typing the same stuff again and again and again and again and ... and you're tired of it?<br />
<br />
That's a good time for a script!<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
say as an editor you've repeatedly had to tune your light entities to get the ambience of your map <em>just right</em>.<br />
Well, you could of course execute three seperate <tt>entproperty</tt> commands - which can be done pretty quickly with the help of the command history - but that's not the end of your laziness, right?<br />
Right!<br />
So you want to have that yellow light entity with properties 64 256 256 192 be about half as bright?<br />

</style><pre class="text" style="font-family:monospace;">loop i 3 [entproperty (+ $i 1) -128]</pre>

and you're done.<br />
<br />
The <tt>loop</tt> will evaluate the body (the stuff inside <tt>[ ]</tt>) 3 times,<br />
each iteration runs with an incremented value of <tt>$i</tt>. In the first loop it is 0, but since we want to modify <tt>entproperty 1</tt> to <tt>entproperty 3</tt> we need to increment it still further - this is done inside the <tt>()</tt> where we use the <tt>+</tt> operator to result in the sum of <tt>$i</tt> and <tt>1</tt>.<br />
So the above line is the same as typing<br />

</style><pre class="text" style="font-family:monospace;">entproperty 1 -128
entproperty 2 -128
entproperty 3 -128</pre>

<br />
In our above example the light entity would end up having the attributes 64 128 128 64.
