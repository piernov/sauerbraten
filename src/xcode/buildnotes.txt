MODERN-BUILD (10.7+)
------------
e.g. using OSX 10.8.2/Xcode 4.5

Change build configuration in Xcode:  Product > Edit Scheme > Archive > Build Configuration=release-deployment

Use file to check executable contains x86_64/i386 binaries



LEGACY-BUILD (10.5 - 10.6)
------------
e.g using OSX 10.6.3/Xcode 3.2

Download and copy in 1.2.14 frameworks to compile against

Ensure compiler is gcc

in project.pbxproj
- remove lines:
	LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS = "@executable_path/../Frameworks";
	MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 10.5;
- and add lines:
	MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET_i386 = 10.4;
	MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET_ppc = 10.3;

Strip the x86_64 binary! (as SDL x86_64 isn't supported until 10.6)
	lipo sauerbraten -remove x86_64 -output sauerbraten_c

use file to check executable contains i386/ppc/7400 binaries





COMBINED-BUILD
--------------

Remove existing SDL frameworks from Frameworks/

Copy 1.2.15 SDL frameworks into Frameworks/1.2.15/
	(no further internal changes necessary because it uses @rpath)

Copy 1.2.14 SDL frameworks into Frameworks/1.2.14/
	- use install_name_tool on each framework and private frameworks to ensure that everything refers to Frameworks/1.2.14/ (because it uses @executable_path)

Rename MODERN-BUILD sauerbraten executable as sauerbraten_u
Rename LEGACY-BUILD sauerbraten executable as sauerbraten_c
Rename xcode/runscript as sauerbraten
